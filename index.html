			<p> &emsp; &emsp; Mr. Rhead, your classes are what brought me my love for and desire to learn computer science. Having started with a simple LEGO robotics class
			and having wound up taking nearly every programming class you offered, the skills I acquired in your classes have fueled me to become a better computer programmer
			and computer nerd as a whole. Your teaching style was always very inviting and helpful, and I'll always remember the way in which you offered to swap me chairs to
			show me a missing semicolon or parenthesis. I hope that you and your wife have a wonderful time after graduation.</p>
